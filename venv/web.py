# and the range is divided into three parts those are [start,stop,step]

# This loops are used to store one loop under another loop so that we can
# get some interesting results.

for x in range(2):

# for this code we have to see x as an outer loop and y as an inner loop
# here python interpreter works in a very different way it opens the outer
# loop and then starts executing the inner loop like here it once the outer
# loop is open all it comes as value of {x} is 0 till it reaches the end of
# the range{y} as 3. Then after getting the last value it goes back to the
# outer loop again and stars the loop until it reaches the end of the inner loop
